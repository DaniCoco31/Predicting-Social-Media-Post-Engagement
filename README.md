# Predicting Social Media Post Engagement

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the engagement levels of social media posts based on their descriptions and other relevant features. Engagement is defined as the sum of interactions a post receives, such as likes and comments. Accurately predicting engagement can help optimize content strategies, maximize reach, and improve overall social media performance.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of social media posts with the following attributes:
- **Post descriptions**
- **Number of likes**
- **Number of comments**
- **Post type** (e.g., image, video)
- **Time of posting**
- **User follower count**

## Project Structure
The project is divided into seven key notebooks, each focusing on different stages of the data science pipeline:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering and merging the base dataset with embedded text data.
2. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:** Handling missing values, filtering data, and preparing it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, relationships, and key patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from text, time, and categorical data to enhance model performance.
5. **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Selection:** Training multiple models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
7. **Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics.

## Setup
### Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** Core programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for running code and documenting analysis.
- **scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting library used for high-performance model training.
- **TensorFlow:** Framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries used for creating data visualizations.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - **Objective:** Collect and merge the base dataset with embedded text data.
   - Load the original dataset and the embeddings.
   - Merge datasets based on common identifiers like `id` and `description`.

2. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**
   - **Objective:** Prepare the data for analysis.
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Filter data based on criteria such as follower count and post activity.
   - Save the cleaned data for further analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Objective:** Gain insights into the data through visualization and statistics.
   - Analyze descriptive statistics like mean, median, and distribution.
   - Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
   - Identify correlations and patterns between features.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Objective:** Enhance the dataset with new features.
   - Generate text-based features such as word count and sentiment scores.
   - Create time-based features like day of the week and hour of posting.
   - Perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
   - Save the engineered features for model training.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Objective:** Prepare the data for machine learning models.
   - Scale numerical features using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Save the preprocessed data for model selection.

6. **Model Selection**
   - **Objective:** Train and evaluate different models.
   - **XGBoost:** A powerful gradient boosting model.
   - **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees for robust predictions.
   - **Gradient Boosting:** Another gradient boosting method.
   - **Neural Networks (TensorFlow):** A deep learning approach to capture complex patterns.
   - Evaluate each model using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

7. **Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Objective:** Optimize model performance through tuning.
   - Use `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters for XGBoost and Random Forest.
   - Evaluate the tuned models on the test set.
   - Save the final model for deployment or further analysis.

## Results and Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Positive sentiment and longer descriptions tend to increase engagement.
- Posting during peak hours results in higher interactions.
- Specific keywords (e.g., "exclusive", "free") are strong predictors of engagement.

### Business Impact
The model provides actionable insights that can help marketers optimize their social media strategies, focusing on content that is more likely to engage users.

### Limitations
- The model is based on specific data and may not generalize across all social media platforms.
- Other engagement metrics like shares and saves were not included due to data limitations.

## Presentation of Findings
### Visualizations
- **Feature Importance:** Visualizations to highlight key predictors of engagement.
- **Predicted vs. Actual Engagement:** Plots to demonstrate model accuracy.

### Recommendations
- **Content Strategy:** Focus on positive, engaging descriptions with key phrases.
- **Posting Schedule:** Post during peak engagement times.
- **A/B Testing:** Use the model to test different content strategies.

## Deployment (Optional)
### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or Django.
- Allow users to input post descriptions and get predicted engagement scores.

### User Interface
- A simple interface where users can input post details and receive predictions.

## Conclusion
### Summary
This project successfully built and optimized a model to predict social media post engagement. The insights can be directly applied to enhance social media content strategies, leading to improved user interaction and brand visibility.

### Next Steps
- Extend the model to include additional engagement metrics like shares and saves.
- Test the model across different social media platforms for generalizability.
