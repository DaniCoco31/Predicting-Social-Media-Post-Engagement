# Predicting Social Media Post Engagement

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the engagement level of social media posts based on their descriptions and other features. Engagement is defined as the interaction a post receives, measured through metrics such as likes and comments. Accurately predicting engagement can help optimize content strategies, maximize reach, and improve overall social media performance.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of social media posts, including attributes like:
- Post descriptions
- Number of likes
- Number of comments
- Post type (e.g., image, video)
- Time of posting
- User follower count

## Project Scope
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate post engagement based on the description and other relevant features. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Setup
### Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and model building (using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and nltk).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and documentation.
- **Tableau/Power BI (Optional):** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **GitHub:** For version control and project sharing.

## Problem Selection and Data Gathering
### Business Case
In the competitive landscape of social media marketing, understanding what drives user engagement is essential. By predicting engagement, businesses can tailor their content to maximize interaction, thereby improving brand visibility and customer loyalty.

### Data Source
Data was collected from social media platforms, containing attributes such as post descriptions, likes, comments, and other relevant features. The data was gathered using APIs or web scraping techniques.

### Initial Data Exploration
Initial exploration showed variability in post descriptions, engagement metrics, and post timing, providing a rich dataset for analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
### Data Cleaning
- Missing values were handled through imputation or removal.
- Outliers were identified and addressed to prevent skewed predictions.

### Feature Engineering
- **Text Features:** Word count, character count, sentiment score, presence of hashtags/mentions.
- **Time Features:** Day of the week, hour of posting, weekend vs. weekday.

### Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization:** Splitting descriptions into individual words.
- **Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase.
- **Stopwords Removal:** Removing common words that do not add significant meaning.
- **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base form.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Descriptive Statistics
- Analyzed the average number of likes and comments per post.
- Examined the distribution of post lengths and corresponding engagement levels.

### Visualization
- Created word clouds to visualize common terms in high-engagement posts.
- Generated histograms to show the distribution of likes and comments.
- Built a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

## Modeling
### Model Selection
- **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost for predicting likes and comments.
- **Text Models:** TF-IDF vectors combined with regression models.

### Training
- Used an 80/20 train-test split with cross-validation for model generalization.
- Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Evaluation
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors in prediction.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** Penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Assesses the proportion of variance in engagement explained by the model.

## Model Optimization
### Tuning
- Hyperparameters like the number of trees in Random Forest and the learning rate in XGBoost were optimized.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve model performance.

### Advanced Techniques
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combined multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Selection:** Used techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select impactful features.

## Results and Interpretation
### Key Findings
- Posts with positive sentiment and longer descriptions tend to receive higher engagement.
- Posting during peak hours significantly impacts engagement.
- Certain keywords (e.g., "free", "exclusive") are strong predictors of engagement.

### Business Impact
- The model provides actionable insights for content creators and marketers to optimize their social media strategies.

### Limitations
- The model may not generalize across all social media platforms due to varying user behaviors.
- Engagement metrics like shares or saves were not included due to data limitations.

## Presentation of Findings
### Visualizations
- Feature importance plots to highlight key predictors of engagement.
- Predicted vs. actual engagement metrics to demonstrate model accuracy.

### Narrative
- The presentation explains the problem definition, data processing steps, model results, and business implications, showcasing how predictive analytics can enhance social media strategies.

### Recommendations
- Focus on creating content with positive sentiment and engaging keywords.
- Post during peak hours for maximum engagement.
- Use the model to A/B test different content strategies.

## Deployment (Optional)
### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy the model as a web service using Flask, allowing users to input new post descriptions and receive engagement predictions.
- Integrate the model into social media management tools for content scheduling.

### User Interface
- A simple web interface where marketers can input post details to get predicted engagement scores.

## Conclusion
### Summary
- The project successfully built a predictive model to estimate social media post engagement based on descriptions and other features. The insights gained can be directly applied to improve social media content strategies.

### Next Steps
- Extend the model to include additional engagement metrics like shares and saves.
- Test the model's generalizability across different social media platforms.
